To use the given coin dataset to classify the coins between 5 categories. The labels of the coins are given in the file names, example if the name of the file is 5_1477145580.jpg then the coin has value 5 which is before ‘_’ in the file name.

Use any machine learning algorithm to create your own classification model.
The model should give 5 outputs (5, 10, 25, 50, 100) that will be the value of that coin.
Split the dataset into training and test sets and provide the accuracy of the test set.
